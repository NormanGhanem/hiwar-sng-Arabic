    <!-- Q&A begins -->
    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: Who is S. Norman Gee, and why does he spark some readers’ curiosity?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: He is a writer and researcher who blends Qur’anic analysis with a critical rational methodology, steering away from sectarian molds or Sufi orders. He starts from the Qur’anic text, the tools of the Arabic tongue, and logic, insisting on the reader’s responsibility to verify rather than passively receive. As stated in <em>Islam Between Universalism and Sectarianism</em>: <span class="quote">“A person who is ignorant of himself lives captive to the minds of others, even if he thinks he is free in thought.”</span> — from <em>Islam Between Universalism and Sectarianism</em></p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: Why do some describe him as having a Sufi tone?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: Because of Qur’anic terms later adopted by Sufi heritage (e.g., Knowledge of Certainty / Eye of Certainty / Truth of Certainty). But with Gee, these levels are restored to their original Qur’anic foundation as <span class="quote">“epistemic stages subject to examination”</span> rather than private mystical states. He says in the trilogy: <span class="quote">“I have nothing to do with those before me except in as much as they hold truth; truth is taken from any vessel from which it flows.”</span> — from <em>Knowledge of Certainty, Eye of Certainty, Truth of Certainty</em></p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: How does he differ from Al‑Ghazali or Ibn Arabi despite some meeting points?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: He shares with them the quest for truth but differs in method: he relies on textual analysis and linguistic‑logical proof rather than mystical experience or esoteric symbolism. He compares, then abstracts, without committing to a path‑bound framework.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: What place does respect for different beliefs and religions have in his thought?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: It is a fixed pillar. He sees diversity as a human norm and seeks shared values. In <em>The Lights of Surah Al‑Hujurat</em>: <span class="quote">“Whoever does not respect the faith of others will never taste the flavor of faith in his own heart.”</span> — from <em>The Lights of Surah Al‑Hujurat</em></p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: So are his books a direct religious call?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: No. He addresses the human as a human, presenting the Qur’an as an epistemic and ethical framework for understanding existence without excluding the other. In <em>The Qur’an as Revealed, Not as Interpreted</em>: <span class="quote">“The river is one, even if the streams are many; the sky is one, even if the observatories differ.”</span> — from <em>The Qur’an as Revealed, Not as Interpreted</em> (forthcoming)</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: What is his main intellectual goal?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: To empower people to know themselves and their source of existence so they can master their own decision‑making. In <em>Companionship in the Qur’an</em>: <span class="quote">“Whoever befriends his own self knows his worth; whoever is ignorant of himself loses it and loses those around him.”</span> — from <em>Companionship in the Qur’an</em></p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: Tell me about the “visual map” of his method.</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: It is not decoration but a work plan: (1) disciplined reception, (2) textual and linguistic examination, (3) comparison with heritage, (4) logical testing, (5) construction and application. Each stage has its own tools and questions, ending with a result that can be understood and critiqued.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: How does he ensure the method doesn’t turn into a hidden ideology?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: By methodological transparency: showing his sources and steps, and inviting the reader to test the results. <span class="quote">“Do not ask anyone to accept your word; ask them to examine with you.”</span> — a recurring rule in his presentation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: And what does he say to those who are content with repeating narrations?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: In <em>Transmission is the Corruption of the Mind</em>: <span class="quote">“Whoever is content with repeating what he hears has turned his mind into a warehouse for voices, not a factory for ideas.”</span> — from <em>Transmission is the Corruption of the Mind</em></p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: What are his primary sources of evidence?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: The Qur’anic text first, then the Arabic tongue (morphology, grammar, semantics, context), then documented history, then the balance of logic (coherence / non‑contradiction / applicability). He tests narrations against this balance — not the other way around.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: How does he approach the “Trilogy of Certainty” away from Sufi classification?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: As a cognitive‑perceptual path: Knowledge of Certainty = proven knowledge; Eye of Certainty = direct observation and understanding, describable in words; Truth of Certainty = practical realization in which truth is embodied in action and decision.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: And what about <em>The Qur’an as Revealed, Not as Interpreted</em>?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: He distinguishes between the infallibility of the source and the humanity of the transmitter, calling for a direct reading that frees the text from the burdens of historical interpretation. He says: <span class="quote">“If we separate the revelation of the Qur’an from its interpretation, we realize the source is infallible and the transmitter is human.”</span> — from <em>The Qur’an as Revealed, Not as Interpreted</em> (forthcoming)</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: Does he defend a particular religion or sect?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: He defends the truth wherever it appears; he rejects the monopoly of salvation and the confinement of truth within sectarian boundaries.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: What about the criticism that his text is “more reflective than documentary”?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: He presents the documentary foundations first (text/language/context), then moves to disciplined reflection. The blend is intentional: documentation leading to living understanding, not the reverse.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: And how does he respond to the charge of “similarity to tradition”?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: He distinguishes between the shared Qur’anic root and the historical traditional system. He benefits from tradition as <span class="quote">“comparative material”</span>, not as a <span class="quote">“binding reference.”</span></p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: Does this method have a practical impact on the reader’s life?</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: Yes: it trains them to test claims, form reasoned positions, and turn faith and knowledge into decisions, ethics, and action.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <p class="q">Questioner: After all this, give me a summary I can carry with me.</p>
      <p class="a">ChatGPT: Here is a summary: keep it close to your heart, make it near to your mind, and let your innermost self hold fast to it: <span class="quote">“Truth is one and does not multiply. Knowing the self is the key to mastery over decision and destiny. Respect every holder of a divine book, for the rivers are many but the sea of truth is one. Do not surrender your mind to blind transmission, and do not cut your heart off from the light of evidence. Test, compare, and take responsibility for what you believe. A faith built on inquiry, justice, and wisdom is a light that never goes out and is never forgotten.”</span></p>
